🪐 Jane's Personal Website

Welcome to the source code of my personal website, hosted via GitHub Pages.

🔗 Visit here: https://imjane.top/ 

This website serves as my digital space to share who I am — my interests, projects, and passions. Built with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, it’s minimal, responsive, and evolving.
